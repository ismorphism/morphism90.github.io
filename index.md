# DeepECG
ECG classification programs based on ML/DL methods. There are two datasets:
 - **training2017.zip** file contains one electrode voltage measurements taken as the difference between RA and LA electrodes with no ground. It is taken from The 2017 PhysioNet/CinC Challenge.
 - **MIT-BH.zip file** contains two electrode voltage measurements: MLII and V5.
